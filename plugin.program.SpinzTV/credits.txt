AfterMath   :  Thank you for developing what this wizard started as and having a program that allows people to develope a wizard.  Without this program I never would have known where to start
and i never would have been able to even get started.

TDB Wizard  :  Speed Test & Backup Restore also thank you for allowing people like myself to see your code and learn from it.  Without being able to do that I never would have learned anything about python at all.
I spent countless hours just staring at the code of your wizard to try and learn whatever I could.  Without being able to do that I never would have been able to even begin to understand anything python.

][NT3L][G3NC][ :  Thank you for all of the help you have been giving me and teaching me along the way.
